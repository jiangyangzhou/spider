# spider
## weibospider
- It is a simple weibo spider for mobile weibo website: weibo.cn
- It was wrote in python2 and it used Request lib.
- The saveInfo.py file contain a class of save the info crawled, including save into .csv, .json, and mysql database. If you want to use database, please specify your database.
- The WeiboReq.py file contain a class requring info from target url. We need weibo account for weibo spider, so I use the cookies to login in. There are still some cookie avaliable, but I am not sure whether they still work. So you can try to buy some accounts and login in manually and get cookies from chrome or firefox by F12.
- To use this weibo spider, please use pip install necessary library, and just modify the codes to meet your needs.
- Good luck! ---By Yangzhou
